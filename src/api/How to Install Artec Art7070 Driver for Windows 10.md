In this article, we will show you how to install the Artec Art7070 driver for Windows 10 in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download the Artec Installation Center (AIC)
 
The Artec Installation Center (AIC) is a software that helps you to install and update the drivers and firmware for your Artec scanner. You can download the AIC version 1.4.4.1 from [this link](https://artecgroup.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/208067845-Drivers-for-discontinued-Artec-scanners-S-M-L-MH-MHT-) or [this mirror](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6z7x9yqk8y9w8yf/AIC_1.4.4.1.zip?dl=0). This version contains the drivers package for discontinued scanners, including the Artec Art7070.
 
## Step 2: Install the AIC and the drivers
 
Once you have downloaded the AIC, unzip the file and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the AIC on your PC. During the installation, the drivers for your Artec scanner will be installed automatically on your PC.
 
## Step 3: Connect your Artec scanner to your PC
 
Make sure your Artec scanner is powered on and connect it to your PC using a USB cable. Open the Windows Device Manager and check if your scanner is recognized as an Artec device under the category "Artec 3D Scanners". If not, you may need to update the drivers manually by following [these steps](https://artecgroup.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207496075-Drivers-for-Artec-Eva-Eva-Lite-Spider-Space-Spider-scanners).
 
## Step 4: Activate or rent your scanner
 
Open the AIC and check if your scanner is shown in either "Activated" or "Rented" status. If not, you will need to activate or rent your scanner using your Artec account credentials. To do so, click on "Activate" or "Rent" button next to your scanner and enter your email and password. If you don't have an Artec account, you can create one [here](https://my.artec3d.com/).
